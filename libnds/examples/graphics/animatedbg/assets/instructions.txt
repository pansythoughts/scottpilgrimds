You must place the tiles of each frame of the animation from left to right, and
from up to down, placing them in an image one after the other.

If the size of each frame is 4x4 tiles in a 32x256 pixel image, for example:

[01][02][03][04]
[05][05][07][07]
[09][10][11][12]
[13][14][15][16]

[..][..][..][..]

In the final image for the animation, of size 256x256 pixels, they would be
placed this way:

[01][02][03][04][05][05][07][07][09][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][..][..][..][..]
