note that this is a very early concept of what could be a 'port' of the original game for this handheld, and therefore, is unfinished. (I just wanted to share it :D.)

## DISCLAIMER
this is an unofficial recreation of Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game, which is made by Ubisoft, based on the Scott Pilgrim visual novels made by Bryan Lee O'Malley. 
this is a non-profit project that just aims to recreate the feeling of the game for the Nintendo DS console. it doesn't aim to take away sales from the original product.

**I DO NOT own any of the sprites, sounds or any assets that were used in this project. they belong to their correspondant authors.**

all credits go to Ubisoft and everyone who worked on the original game.
